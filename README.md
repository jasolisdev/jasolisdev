# Jose Solis

**Software Engineer • Full-Stack Developer • Systems & UI Builder**  
📍 Southern California

I build software at the intersection of **engineering rigor**, **design clarity**, and **real-world problem solving**.  
My work spans systems-level programming, modern full-stack web applications, and long-lived tooling designed for performance, maintainability, and scale.

I value clean architecture, thoughtful UX, and codebases that age well.
